Questions for WhiteHat Club


Name : Praneel Shankar Tiwari

Reason for Joining : My main reason for joining this club is that CyberSecurity is a domain which is extremely new and booming in Computer Science and in a world where cyberattacks are becoming more often and more high profile, so there is a need to protect valuable data and build secure systems so as to prepare ourselves for a digitally safe and sound world.  I want to use the oppurtunity of joining of this club to meet and connect with fellow peers who are interested in CyberSecurity, develop practical skills and learn through hands-on activities and teamwork, so as to build a good future and career in cybersecurity after college.

CyberSecurity Incident - The most recent one I heard of was the "rnicrosoft.com" mail instead of a "microsoft.com" mail. This incident really caught my eye because the difference between the real and fake IDs was so subtle that most of us wouldn't even look at it carefully and just click it without any sort of verification.
